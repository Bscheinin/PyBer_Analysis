# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The PyBer ride sharing company has requested an analysis of ride-sharing data by different city types using two different data sources. This analysis includes the combination of these data sources to provide information about the average rides per city type, average fare per city type and average fare per driver in the different city types. An additional analysis provided the total fares by city type for period of time.

## Results
The results of the analysis of the combined data sources is shown in the chart below.

These results show that a large majority of revenue is generated from the Urban city types at 61% of total revenue. The Suburban city types accounts for 30% of revenue, while the Rural city types make up only 7% of revenues. In addition, this chart shows the Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver for the three city types. These revenue figures are not surprising given the total rides and total drivers comparisons:
- Urban: 2,405 drivers provided 1,625 rides
- Suburban: 490 drivers provided 625 rides
- Rural: 78 drivers provided 125 rides

The total fares by city type data in the multi-line graph shows the weekly average fares for a four month period. It is not surprising that the Urban city type provides a much higher weekly average fare than the other two city types given the higher number of rides and drivers in the urban area.

## Summary
The inital data analysis and deeper look into the total fare by city type information provides the basis for three business recommendations. the first recommendation is for the Pyber to continue to maintain its strong presence in Urban cities to ensure ongoing revenue. Secondly, increased revenue and market share gains may be realized by additional investment in the Suburban and Rual areas as the fare per ride and fare per driver for these city types is much higher than the Urban city type. This strategy has been used by other industry leaders to ensure increased revenue growth in higher fare areas while maintaining the core business of serving urban areas. Finally, the total fares data should be assessed again once an entire year's worth of data is available. This will allow seasonal trends to be considered before further recommendations are made for the different city types.
